This git-repository contains a LaTeX-Template for Diploma, Mater and Batchelor-
thesis which was originally designed for the use at the 'Fachgebiet Elektrische
Messtechnik' at the University of Paderborn (Germany). 

In this template, there are missing two files:
- img/uni-logo.eps and
- img/fg-logo.eps

Please add eps-files with this names for your university and 'Fachgebiet'. 
Students at Fachgebiet EMT of University of Paderborn can get the files
from the EMT-Wiki.

This LaTeX-template is avaiable for free usage and modification for everybody. 
If you find any bugs or know some improvements, please send patches to
	fruoff@webmail.uni-paderborn.de
