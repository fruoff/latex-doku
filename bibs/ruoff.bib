	abstract = "Clustering in the neural-network literature is generally based on the competitive learning paradigm. The paper addresses two major issues associated with conventional competitive learning, namely, sensitivity to initialization and difficulty in determining the number of prototypes. In general, selecting the appropriate number of prototypes is a difficult task, as we do not usually know the number of clusters in the input data a priori. It is therefore desirable to develop an algorithm that has no dependency on the initial prototype locations and is able to adaptively generate prototypes to fit the input data patterns. We present a new, more powerful competitive learning algorithm, self-splitting competitive learning (SSCL), that is able to find the natural number of clusters based on the one-prototype-take-one-cluster (OPTOC) paradigm and a self-splitting validity measure. It starts with a single prototype randomly initialized in the feature space and splits adaptively during the learning process until all clusters are found; each cluster is associated with a prototype at its center. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSCL algorithm. The results show that SSCL has the desired ability for a variety of applications, including unsupervised classification, curve detection, and image segmentation",

	abstract = "The Self-Splitting Competitive Learning (SSCL) based on the one-prototype-take-one-cluster (OPTOC) learning paradigm is a powerful algorithm that solves the difficult problems of determining the number of clusters and the sensitivity to prototype initialization in clustering. The SSCL algorithm iteratively partitions the data space into natural clusters without a priori information on the number of clusters. However, SSCL fails to estimate the correct cluster number in some cases such as when there is a cluster whose centroid is coincided with the global centroid in the data set, and the speed of learning process is slow. In this paper, we propose the Robust Self-Splitting Competitive Learning (RSSCL) algorithm with a new update scheme and a new split-validity criterion to solve the problems mentioned above. We compare the performance of RSSCL to SSCL in synthesized Gaussian data set and the universal text collection, Reuters-21578. Experiments show that RSSCL improves the precision to estimate correct cluster number and is more efficient and has more adaptability than SSCL. Results on text clustering show that RSSCL performs better than SSCL on the high-dimensional dataset.",
